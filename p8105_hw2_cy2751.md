## Problem 1

``` r
NYCTransit_df <- read_csv(
  "datasets_hw2/NYC_Transit_Subway_Entrance_And_Exit_Data.csv",na = "",
  col_types = cols(Route8 = "c", Route9 = "c", Route10 = "c", Route11 = "c")) %>% 
  janitor::clean_names() %>% 
  select(line,station_name,station_latitude,station_longitude,(route1:route11),
         entry,exit_only,vending,entrance_type,ada) %>% 
  mutate(entry = ifelse(entry == "YES",T,F))
```

This dataset contains information of all train stations in NYC.
Including variables train line, station name, the specific location of
the station( latitude and longitude),all routes inside each station,
entry and exit information, vending information, entrance type and
whether ada compliance or not. I clean the data by importing data,
identify `NA` values, specify the variable type of all routes. I also
update variables names and select only the useful variables for the
later question. Lastly, update variable `entry` to be a logical
variable. Current dataset has dimension 1,868 × 20.  
We cannot say these data are tidy, because when we need to focus on
specific routes, routes should be a variable rather than a column
name.

# remove month and year for tidy reason, date already includes such information
```

We combined three datasets: `Mr_Trash` dataset, `Professor_Trash`
dataset and `Gwynnda_Trash` dataset. Each contains information about
every dumpsters, including the date we collected data on, weight of
trash it deals with in ton, volume of trash and amount of each kind of
trash such as plastic bottles,polystyrene…. It is noteworthy that sports
ball is a unique trash that only exists in `Mr_Trash` dataset and there
is no glass bottle inside `Gwynnda_Trash` dataset.  
For `Mr_Trash` dataset, we collected information from 651 dumpsters;  

For `Professor_Trash` dataset, we collected information from 118
dumpsters;  

For `Gwynnda_Trash` dataset, we have information for 262 dumpsters,
while we have 263 pieces of information, it is because we have two rows
for dumpster 21, but on the different date;  

The final dataset has 1032 observations in total. For each observation,
we have 13 variables. We removed `month` and `year` variable in the
final dataset because these are redundant variables, we can also see
these information in `date` variable.  
We added a new column `name` to the final dataset, which indicates which
Trash Wheel does this dumpster come from.

``` r
Professor_Trash_df %>% select(weight_tons) %>% sum()
```

    ## [1] 246.74

The total weight of trash collected by Professor Trash Wheel is 246.74
tons.  

``` r
Gwynnda_Trash_df %>% 
  filter(month == "June", year == "2022") %>% 
  select(cigarette_butts) %>% 
  sum()
```

    ## [1] 18120

The total number of cigarette butts collected by Gwynnda in June of 2022
is 18120.

For the data cleaning process, I first imported all three datasets and
clean their names. Separating bakers’ full name into `first name` and
`last name`. Since in the other two datasets, we only use their first
name. And then, by viewing individual datasets and using `anti-join`
function, checking bakers’ information in between any two of the
datasets, for example: to see if there is any bakers inside `bakers`
dataset but not in `bakes` dataset, here are my findings:  
There are 23 bakers appears in `bakers` dataset but not inside `bakes`
dataset. It is because `bakes` only contains information from series 1 -
8, so it is reasonable that some bakers only exists in `bakers` dataset
but not inside `bakes` dataset, like bakers attending series 9 and 10 .
There is one exception: `"Jo"`, which matches our result in checking
bakers in `bakes` that are not in `bakers`. We should remove the
quotation mark for this cell in order for it to match.  

By applying `anti_join` twice on `bakers` and `results`, we can see the
bakers `Joanne` may use her name `Jo` to apply for the competition,
because it is the only situation that does not match, we can assume she
was using nick name to apply for this competition, so in datasets `bake`
and `baker`, the name cannot match with the rows in `results`. Also, the
`series` information matches. We should do data cleaning to solve this
issue. For simplicity, we will change the name in `results` dataset.  

After cleaning the data, we can see except for the `bakes` dataset only
have limit information, all other `auto_join` results becomes 0, which
means dataset can join perfectly with all information.  

Also, the order of joining dataset does matters! On my first try, I
joint `bakes` and `bakers` first, and use this combined dataset to join
the `results` dataset. But issue appears in the final dataset: since one
baker may have multiple dishes, so we apply `left_join` on bakes and
bakers, but the joint dataset will not contain information for bakers in
series 9 and 10. Accordingly, joining this dataset with `results` will
lead to no bakers information for all bakers in series 9 and 10. This is
an interesting finding I noticed. So I switch my order of joining
dataset: joining `bakers` and `results` first, ensure every bakers get
their personal information. And join `bakes` at last. In this case, we
can avoid information incompleteness.  

After getting this single, final dataset, we combine bakers’ first name
and last name together for simplicity. And then reorganize the order:
first showing the series and episode, and then bakers’ name and their
dishes, with their ranking and results. Their personal information comes
at last place. Last but not least, we can see this dataset is kind of
redundant, because some bakers are OUT but their names still showing up
in every episode of that series, we will delete these rows to keep our
dataset simply and more logical. In this way, the last appearance of
each baker is at the time they are OUT.  

The final tidy dataset is called `bakers_all_info_tidy`, it has 710 rows
and 10 columns: these columns showing the series, episode, bakers’
names, name of the bake,show_stopper, baker’s ranking, results,and
baker’s personal information including their age, occupation and
hometown.

**Were there any predictable overall winners? Any surprises? **

We will discuss this question by series order:  
In series 5, winner is kind of surprise, it seems Richard Burr gots more
times of star baker;  
In series 6, winner is predictable, Nadiya Hussain has been rated as
star baker many times before.  
In series 7, winner is also predictable.  
In series 8, winner is also predictable.  
In series 9, winner is also predictable.  
In series 10, winner is surprising, he has not been rated as star baker
before.
